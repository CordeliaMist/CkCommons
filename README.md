## What Is CkCommons?

**CkCommons** is a modular library tailored for use with Dalamud plugin projects. It offers utility classes, customizable widgets, helper methods, and quality-of-life abstractions to reduce boilerplate and streamline plugin development.

In addition, CkCommons includes a robust ImGui wrapper, **CkGui**, which enhances the visual styling of ImGui elements without sacrificing rendering performance.

## Adding CkCommons to Your Project

To integrate CkCommons as a Git submodule in your plugin repository, run:

```bash
git submodule add https://github.com/CordeliaMist/CkCommons.git
```

If CkCommons is not already referenced as a submodule, manually include it in your `.csproj` file:

```xml
<ItemGroup>
    <ProjectReference Include="..\CkCommons\CkCommons.csproj" />
</ItemGroup>
```

### Initialization

To use features that rely on Dalamud plugin services (hooks, textures, data, etc.), **you must manually initialize CkCommons**. Dependency injection is not supported.

In your `IDalamudPlugin` entry point:

```csharp
CkCommonsMain.Init(pluginInterface, this);
```

Where `pluginInterface` is the `IDalamudPluginInterface` instance provided by Dalamud.

### Disposal

On plugin unload (or when your runtime service scope is disposed, if using DI), call:

```csharp
CkCommonsMain.DisposeAll();
```
